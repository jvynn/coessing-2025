# Welcome to the physical oceanography model of the Ocean Margins Initiative at COESSING 2025! 
We're going to be looking at **real** data from the ocean (pretty cool). You can find some code to visualize the data in this repository. 

To make getting python working easy, I've exported a working conda environment in this repo. Follow the steps below to get it working on your machine. 

# Setup Conda Environment for Project

### Step 1: Download the environment file
Download `coessing-2025.yaml` from the project repository.

### Step 2: Create the environment
Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt, then run:

```bash
conda env create -f coessing-2025.yaml
