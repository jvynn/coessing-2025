# Welcome to the physical oceanography model of the Ocean Margins Initiative at COESSING 2025! 
We're going to be looking at **real** data from the ocean (pretty cool) to investigate the interaction between biological and physical processes off the coast of Ghana. There are two Jupyter notebooks in this repository we'll be using: 
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: An introduction to using Python for physical oceanographic data analysis, including tools like **xarray** and the Gibbs Seawater Toolbox, **gsw**.
- `biophysical_modeling.ipynb`: A simplified model that we'll use to explore nutrient-phytoplankton dynamics and make comparisons to observational data. 

There are two ways to access the notebooks. Feel free to choose whichever method you feel most comfortable withâ€”weâ€™ll be available to help at the start of the workshop no matter what.

---
## Option 1: Access the notebooks **online** (easiest)

No installation required! Just click the link below and the repository will launch in an external browswer window with all packages pre-installed.

Note this option requires a stable internet connection.


## Option 2: Install python and setup the **Conda environment** locally (intermediate)

This method may be preferable if you're familiar with Python and the terminal interface since it gives you the most control. It also more closely aligns with the workflows we commonly use in scientific computing! It requires you to install Anaconda, which includes Python and a package manager in one download.

If you already have Anaconda installed, skip to **Step 2**

### Step-by-step instructions:

1. **Install Anaconda**  

   Download and install Anaconda for your system:  
   ðŸ”— [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
   
   You can install Miniconda if you prefer - it's a smaller version of the program that includes everything we'll need for this workshop. 

   If you're new to command line tools, you can check out these video walkthroughs:  
   - [Windows installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DQGBQMvwZo) (note: I would install GitBash **before** installing Anaconda; make sure you *add to PATH* during installation like she does in the tutorial)  
   - [Mac installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Hhqf8L-b_0)

1. **Download the repository**  
   - Either [download the ZIP](https://github.com/jvynn/coessing-2025/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it,  
   - Or install git (if you haven't already) by running:
     ```bash
     conda install -c conda-forge git
     ```
     and then clone the repo:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/jvynn/coessing-2025.git
     ```

1. **Open a terminal** and navigate to the folder where you've downloaded the repository (contains ``environment.yml``).

1. **Create and activate the Conda environment**  
   
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ``` 
   This may take a few minutes! Once it has completed you will see instructions on how to activate and deactivate the environment. To activate, run:
   ```bash
   conda activate coessing-2025
   ```

1. **Register your environment as a kernel and launch JupyterLab**
    
    Once the environment is activated, run:
    ```bash
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name coessing-2025 --display-name "Python (coessing-2025)"
    ```
    to register the environment within JupyterLab, and then run:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    This will launch the JupyterLab server locally and open your web browser automatically at ``http://localhost:8888/lab``. If it doesn't automatically open, you can copy and paste one of the URLs it spits out (typically ``http://localhost:8888/lab?token=[string of numbers and letters]``). 

1. **Choose the right kernal and open the notebooks** 

    Explore the JupyterLab interface - it's takes a moment to get used to but is fairly intuitive! Make sure your notebook is using the correct Python kernel.
    - Look at the top right corner of the notebook (shows the current kernel name).
    - Click the kernel name and choose ``"Python (coessing-2025)"`` if itâ€™s not already selected.
